Systems capable of reducing energy consumption are needed in order to reduce monetary energy costs for companies. At the same time, studies show that temperature can influence human productivity, thus simply removing \ac{HVAC} systems could impact negatively a company's employees work productivity.

Nowadays \ac{BAS} are used to manage a building, however traditional systems face a big problem, they have high monetary costs associated with installation and hardware. At the same time, the market is flooded with cheaper tablet devices with built-in sensors, connectivity and visual display.

In this document, we propose a system to address the energy consumption problem, increase occupant comfort and offer security, including intrusion detection notification and video monitoring, to the user. The proposed system differs from traditional centralized \ac{BAS} by offering a distributed architecture with nodes deployed in every office and a user mobile application capable of interacting with the system. 
The system is designed to work with off the shelf Android tablets, the tablet runs a mobile application and is responsible for managing the room it is installed in.
