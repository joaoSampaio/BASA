Systems capable of reducing energy consumption are needed in order to reduce monetary energy costs for companies. At the same time, studies show that temperature can influence human productivity, thus simply removing \ac{HVAC} systems could impact negatively a company's employees work productivity.

Nowadays \ac{BAS} are used to manage a building, however traditional systems face a big problem, they have high monetary costs associated with installation and hardware. At the same time, the market is flooded with cheaper tablet devices with built-in sensors, connectivity and visual display.

In this document, we propose a system that utilizes an Android tablet, mounted in the room wall, running an application to achieve building automation. Our solution addresses the energy consumption problem, increases occupant comfort and offers security, including intrusion detection notification and video monitoring, to the user. The proposed system differs from traditional centralized \ac{BAS} by offering a distributed architecture with nodes deployed in every office and a user mobile application capable of interacting with the system.
