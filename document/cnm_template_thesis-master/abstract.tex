Systems capable of reducing energy consumption are needed in order to reduce costs for companies and environmental destruction. At the same time studies show that temperature can influence human productivity, thus simply removing HVAC systems could impact negatively a company's employees work productivity.
In this document, we propose a system to address the energy consumption problem, increase occupant comfort and offer security including intrusion detection notification and video monitoring to the user. The proposed system differs from traditional centralized \ac{BAS} by offering a distributed architecture with nodes deployed in every office and a user mobile application capable of interacting with the system.
